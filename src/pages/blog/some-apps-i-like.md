Something I always have is an ongoing list of apps I love. You know when you get a new app and you start using it and it’s just like...

“YES THIS IS AWESOME.”

Well, I’ve found that that feeling doesn’t come too often, so it is worth it to take note of those apps that curate that feeling. 

Here are three apps I currently admire for different reasons, but all have something in common: 
they provided me a great user experience.

## Duolingo

- Easy to get started
- Immediately pulls me in
- Simple design that sticks with solid teaching methodology (repetition, voice, text, visuals)
- When you stop doing your daily lessons, they send you this message for a while:
  
And then.. Once it’s been too long, they send you THIS message:

NEVER FAILS to get me to open the app again and recommit to my learning goals. 

Genius. 

Even if it doesn’t get you to open the app again, at least it prevents the app from getting annoying. 

This feature gained my trust. 

## chatbooks

- Easy to get started 
- Great price for photo books
- The info I need is easily accessible/ their search function is great
- Prompt customer service

I had placed an order only to realize moments later that I put the wrong shipping address. I sent an in-app message. I have contacted their customer service reps before with a great response. Sure enough, the fixed the problem immediately, gaining my trust again.

Have you ever been prompted by a chat feature on a website or in an app, only to have an automated response sent and no help given, OR NO ONE EVEN RESPONDS. For me, this only takes once and I am DONE using that platform. If companies offer customer service instant chats, they need to be work or need to rid of the feature all together.

## New york times cooking

- Great content (pictures, reviews, videos)
- Interesting once a week emails that combine recipes with things that are relatable (see example)
- When you login, you are LOGGED IN across all screens 

Meaning, when I find a recipe on NYT Cooking on Facebook or a Google search, and I click it, I can select this feature “save to recipe box.” Later, I can go into the app and retrieve all of my recipes I’ve saved! I hate when a platform makes you continually log-in. I understand this may be a security issue, but for some apps I find myself logging in again and again for no reason.

**Good code = good user experience.**
